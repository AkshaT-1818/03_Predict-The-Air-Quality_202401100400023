Air quality is a critical factor affecting both environmental health and human well-being. Increasing urbanization, industrial activity, and vehicle emissions have led to a surge in air pollution levels across the globe. Monitoring and predicting air quality have thus become essential for public safety, policy-making, and environmental conservation.
This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict the air quality level using key environmental parameters such as:

PM2.5 (Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm) – tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs,

NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide) – a harmful gas primarily emitted by vehicles and power plants,

Temperature – which influences chemical reactions in the atmosphere and pollutant dispersion.
